# Overview

League of Legends (LoL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. Two teams of five players compete to destroy the enemy team's Nexus (base) while defending their own. Players control unique characters called "champions," each with specialized abilities and roles, making strategy, teamwork, and skill crucial to victory.

This project aims to predict the outcomes of professional League of Legends matches using in-game event data and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for classification. By analyzing features such as total gold, team statistics, and side selection, the project develops a machine learning pipeline to classify match results and uncover factors influencing match outcomes.

## Key Highlights:
- **Dataset**: Includes match data with team-specific stats, filtered for completeness and relevance.
- **Modeling**: Utilized **KNN** for classification, optimizing hyperparameters like the number of neighbors to improve performance.
- **Performance**: Achieved competitive accuracy by leveraging in-game features and validating model results.

This project showcases the use of machine learning in esports analytics, offering insights into key predictors of match outcomes and strategies for competitive play.
